# About Me

I'm not one to talk about myself a lot. The name should give it away.

I chose the name `secret_online` because I wanted to show to my parents that I was going to be responsible online, and that every time I saw my name it'd remind me. That was many years ago now, and I haven't been able to choose a better name.

The underscore is *important*. If your service doesn't allow underscores in usernames, then you need to fix that (just use `\w` in your regex). Usually, for those that don't support underscores, I use the name `SecretOnline`.

If you're one of those people who like to see what people do, then head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/SecretOnline). You'll find most of the small projects I do to keep me busy when I'm not.
