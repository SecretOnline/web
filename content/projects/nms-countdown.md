Before the release of [No Man's Sky](http://www.no-mans-sky.com/), I was a reasonably active member of the game's community on the [/r/NoMansSkyTheGame subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame).

At the time, IGN was doing a month-long coverage of the game, releasing new articles or interviews every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The subreddit ended up getting many questions asking "*when's the next IGN article coming out*"?

Many users on the subreddit were getting annoyed at these questions, myself included. I wasn't just going to sit around and complain, so I put my skills to use, and made a [countdown](https://countdown.nmsdb.info).

Countdown sites already existed on the internet, so I wanted to make this one different. Since it was for /r/NoMansSkyTheGame, I made it No Man's Sky themed. I started by taking screenshots of the game, and putting them as a background of the page. I then approached some of those who had posted fan art on the subreddit, and asked if I could use their art on the countdown (giving credit, of course). They were happy to do that, so I added their images to the list as well.

I wanted to go further with it, though. I liked the visual style of the No Man's Sky UI, and I wanted to add that in to the countdown. After a bit of thinking, I thought of making the shield bar into the progress bar for a song.

One of the users on the subreddit started hanging out on the #nomanssky channel on the Snoonet IRC server, and also started writing No Man's Sky inspired music. He was more than happy to have his music on the countdown. I had the idea, I had the music, not all I needed to do was many *many* hours of playing around with CSS to make it all look good.
