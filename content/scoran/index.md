# Vanilla Minecraft, with friends

Minecraft is a diverse game.

There are so many things to do. Some servers offer a little bit of everything. Minigames, PvP action, Arcade-style games, and many others.

Scoran is a server that decided to do what Minecraft was made for: Survival.

Survival is what the game has been focused on for over 4 years, so survival is what Scoran has been focused on for its lifetime.

We are a small whitelisted server that focuses on survival and community. We have people from all over the world playing with us. We are diverse and open to new people.

*Note: Previously there was a link to apply for the server here. That has ben removed, as the server has shut down.*

## Community

Just having a website is not enough to keep in touch with the community. It's a very restrictive form of communication. For this reason we use [reddit](https://reddit.com) as a forum and [Discord](https://discordapp.com) while playing.

### Reddit

Scoran has its own subreddit. This is a place where you can share what you've been doing on the server, as well as any announcements that need to be made.</p><p>If you already have a reddit account, you can subscribe to [/r/scoran](https://reddit.com/r/scoran). If not, don't worry. You don't need an account to see everything.

### Discord

Sometimes it is easier to just talk to the people you are playing with. For that purpose, we have [a Discord server](https://discord.gg/px49r).

Discord is a mix between IRC (until now the best text-based chat protocol) and Teamspeak/Mumble (the big players in voice communication). It brings the two together in a nice package, based on modern web technologies.

If you have a microphone, then you can talk with us. If not, you can just listen in and use the text chat.

*Note: The invite link for Discord has expired. If you were a member of the minecraft server before it shut down, just [let me know](/about/#Contact) and I'll send you a new link.*
