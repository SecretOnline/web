Pretty much what the title says.

Moving the website from being something I create everything for (clone existing page, edit content, build), I'll be using a framework ([Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/)) to do most of the work for me.

The result is similar to what I would have written (I was about to start writing a mini framework for React), but quite a bit better.
